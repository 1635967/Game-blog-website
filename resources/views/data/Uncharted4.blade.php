						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p><b>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</b> is a 2016 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by 
						Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the fourth main entry in the Uncharted series. Set five years after the events of
						Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, players control Nathan Drake, a former treasure hunter coaxed out of retirement by 
						his estranged brother Samuel. With Nathan's longtime partner, Sullivan, they search for clues for the location of 
						Henry Avery's long-lost treasure. A Thief's End is played from a third-person perspective, and incorporates platformer 
						elements. Players solve puzzles and use firearms, melee combat, and stealth to combat enemies. In the online multiplayer
						mode, up to ten players engage in co-operative and competitive modes.</p>
						
						<p>Development of Uncharted 4 began in 2011, soon after the release of Uncharted 3. It was led by creative director 
						Amy Hennig and game director Justin Richmond. Development was hampered in 2014 due to Hennig and Richmond's departure
						from Naughty Dog; they were replaced by Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley. The team sought to incorporate elements of 
						open-world gameplay, with larger levels to encourage free-roaming exploration and combat. The relationship between 
						Nathan and Elena was central, and Naughty Dog attempted to humanize them more than in previous games.
						A Thief's End was released in May 2016 for the PlayStation 4. It was Naughty Dog's first game developed specifically 
						for the PlayStation 4. The team took advantage of the advanced hardware to process larger dynamic environments.</p>
						
						<p>Following its announcement in November 2013, A Thief's End was widely anticipated. The game was acclaimed by reviewers, 
						particularly for its gameplay, narrative, emotional depth, visuals, and multiplayer. Several reviewers found the game a
						worthy conclusion to Nathan's story. It won several year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several 
						gaming publications, critics, and game award ceremonies. With over 15 million copies sold, it is the highest-selling
						Uncharted game and one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 games. A standalone expansion, The Lost Legacy, was released in 2017.</p>
